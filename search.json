    "text": "2 Descriptive statistics recap\nAn essential component of being a sport and exercise scientist is the ability to summarise results collected from groups or individuals correctly. Luckily many of summary statistics that you will need are things that you would have covered in yr 8 and 10 mathematics. These are parameters such as mean, median, mode, standard deviation (SD) and coefficient of variation (CV%).\nAn important aspect to remember is the idea of data we collect from a group we being considered a “sample” from the population. To help build your intuition around this, lets say i wanted to summarise the sprint test results collected from SPRT2002. Now lets say I only used one practical class sprint times to reflect the full cohort of SPRT2002. It would be reasonable for you to say that I am using a sample from the full cohort to represent the sprint capability. This situation effectively anytime we collect data from a group as there always some of the population of interest using missing from our sample.\nThe visual below allows you to randomly sample data from a distribution. Have a play around with both the sample size and population SD sliders and see what you notice."

HELPFUL TIP: The more attention you pay to the quality of your data during this final lab, the better your report will be\n\n\n1.1.2 Background:\nMaximal sprinting speed and its derivate acceleration have both been shown to be key discriminators in playing status across many sports. Whilst, performing a maximal sprint test would give the most valid insight into these qualities, it may not always be possible to perform this test in a practical environment due factors such as, perceived risk of injury and cost of equipment (timing gates, radar gun etc). Hence, identifying cost effective test that may give insight into these qualities is of interest.\nTwo commonly used test that are used as both proxy measures of acceleration and sprinting speed respectively are the standing broad jump (SBJ) and assessment of lower limb stiffness. Whilst a number of techniques for measuring lower limb stiffness exist, the test we will focus on today is the drop jump test.\nPART 1 of today will involve collecting data across a 0-10m sprint test, standing broad jump and drop jump test (look to get at least two trials across each test). Data collected from this will be uploaded on vUWS where we’ll then look do PART 2 aims of today which involve calculating basic summary statistics that represent the mean and spread/deviation of the data."

    "text": "1.2 Practical Procedures (PART 1):\n\n1.2.1 Broad Jump\nAfter completing a standardised warm-up administered by the tutor, you will complete a series of maximal effort horizontal jumps. The individual being tested needs to stand behind a marker on the ground, with their toes directly in line with the marker. They are then permitted to do a counter-movement before they jump. By this we mean that the individual is allowed to bend their knees and trunk and to swing their arms before take-off to help them generate power. The landing must be on both feet, and the effort should be repeated if the individual falls backwards or takes a step before take-off. The standard procedure is for a two-foot take off and landing, where distance between the toes and the first landing point (or heel-strike) identified by the assessor is recorded. Continue until everyone has completed all efforts. Be sure to record the maximal distance achieved.\n\n\n1.2.2 Max speed assessment\nData Collection: You will be required to gather into groups of 4 or 5, and establish a testing order within the group. After completing the standardised warm-up administered by the tutor, you will complete a pre-determined number of maximal sprint efforts over a 10m distance (with a timing gate at 5m also). Your times will be recorded automatically by electronic timing gates (Swift SpeedLight TimingTM Gates) as well as by your group members (handheld stopwatches). Be sure to record all times so that you are able to match each electronic timer score with those recorded by your peers with the stopwatch. Continue until everyone has completed all efforts.\n\n\n1.2.3 Drop Jump assessment\n\n Stand on a box or elevated platform behind.\nPlace your hands on your hips.\nKeep your chest up and look forward.\nStep off the box; then.\nLand on the plates with both feet at the same time;\nImmediately jump as high as possible; then\nLand softly, remaining completely still on the jump mat.\nRecord RSI from device"
