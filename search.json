HELPFUL TIP: The more attention you pay to the quality of your data during this lab, the easier it will be to complete your professional.\n\n\n1.1.2 Background:\nMaximal sprinting speed and its derivative acceleration have both been shown to be key discriminators in playing status across many sports. Whilst, performing a maximal sprint test would give the most valid insight into these qualities, it may not always be possible to perform this test in a practical environment due factors such as, perceived risk of injury and cost of equipment (timing gates, radar gun etc). Hence, identifying cost effective test that may give insight into these qualities is of interest.\nTwo commonly used test that are used as both proxy measures of acceleration and sprinting speed respectively are the standing broad jump (SBJ) and assessment of lower limb stiffness. Whilst a number of techniques for measuring lower limb stiffness exist, the test we will focus on today is the drop jump test.\nPART 1 of today will involve collecting data across a 0-5 and 0-10m sprint test, standing broad jump and drop jump test (look to get at least two trials across each test). PART 2 aims of today involve calculating basic summary statistics that represent the mean and spread/deviation of the data and other descriptive statistics discussed in the lecture.",
