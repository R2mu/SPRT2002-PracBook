HELPFUL TIP: The more attention you pay to the quality of your data during this lab, the easier it will be to complete your professional.\n\n\n1.1.2 Background:\nMaximal sprinting speed and its derivative acceleration have both been shown to be key discriminators in playing status across many sports. Whilst, performing a maximal sprint test would give the most valid insight into these qualities, it may not always be possible to perform this test in a practical environment due factors such as, perceived risk of injury and cost of equipment (timing gates, radar gun etc). Hence, identifying cost effective test that may give insight into these qualities is of interest.\nTwo commonly used test that are used as both proxy measures of acceleration and sprinting speed respectively are the standing broad jump (SBJ) and assessment of lower limb stiffness. Whilst a number of techniques for measuring lower limb stiffness exist, the test we will focus on today is the drop jump test.\nPART 1 of today will involve collecting data across a 0-5 and 0-10m sprint test, standing broad jump and drop jump test (look to get at least two trials across each test). PART 2 aims of today involve calculating basic summary statistics that represent the mean and spread/deviation of the data and other descriptive statistics discussed in the lecture.",

You hopefully feel comfortable with the idea that any measurement we collect has some uncertainty around it. That uncertainty may be due to biological variation, technology and or methodology error, which all limit our confidence in reporting a “true” measurement. We aim to represent this uncertainty in a similar fashion to what we did last week with the 95% Confidence interval.\nTo calculate the CI around the score values (point A and B), we use a similar procedure that we did last week when calculate the 95% CI around a sample mean, with the only difference being instead of using a standard error, we will use something called the typical error.\nFor example,\nPoint A score = 50. For a given value of the Typical Error slider, e.g. 3 the 95 % CI would be\n50 - (3 * 1.96) = 44.1 to 50 + (3 * 1.96) = 55.9\nThis interval represents our uncertainty around where we believe the true measurement might be. From an interpretation perspective we can’t say the probability of the true value being between the lower limit and upper limit is 95%, rather that the method we used to create the interval has a 95% success rate in capturing true values over the long run.\nWe can also calculate an uncertainty around the change score observed between these two measurements (A and B). Now that we are comparing two measurements that both come with uncertainty we have to consider that when calculating a CI for a change score we do so with the equation below.\nChange 95% LL (Point B - Point A observed values) - sqrt(2) * TE * 1.96\nChange 95% UL (Point B - Point A observed values) + sqrt(2) * TE * 1.96\nThe sqrt(2) is included because we now have two trials that both have a potential source of uncertainty. The addition of the sqrt(2) as you can see makes the CI larger for change scores than for individual observations.\n\n  \n    Interactive Difference Plot\n    \n    \n      \n        Change Score:\n        \n        \n      \n      \n      \n        Typical Error:\n        \n        \n      \n      \n      \n        Between-Subject SD:\n        \n        \n      \n      \n      \n        SD Multiplier:\n        \n        \n      \n    \n    \n    \n      \n         Show Confidence Intervals\n      \n      \n         Show SWC\n      \n    \n    \n    \n  \n\n  \n\nTwo more measures we discussed in the lecture that can also be calculated from an understanding of TE are the minimal detectable change MDC and minimal clinically import difference MCID. Both of these are commonly reported to a 95% confidence level so will be multiplied by 1.96 respectively.\nMDC_95 = TE * sqrt(2) * 1.96\nMCID_95 = MDC_95 + SWC\nWhilst there are may ways we can identify a value considered the smallest worthwhile change (SWC), a commonly used method is to multiply the between subject SD by some factor. In exercise and sport science a commonly used factor is 0.2 therefore;\nSWCsml = SD * 0.2 (Small)\nSWCmdr = SD * 0.6 (Moderate)\nSWClrg = SD * 0.6 (Large)",
